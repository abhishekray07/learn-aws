# Deploying a Ghost blog to AWS using Docker, Terraform and Ansible


purpose of blog post:
help people be able to deploy a blog to AWS easily without having to do any manual configuration.


Main benefits
- automate everything
- we use terraform to create the instance
- we use ansible to provision the instance (install ghost)
- we use docker to run the ghost blog
- we don't have to worry about installing any libraries or packages ourself.
- the whole setup should take less than 15 minutes.
